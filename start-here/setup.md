# Setup

### Setup your training environment

This training uses an automated training environment which will streamline the setup process.  There are only two tools you need to install, Docker and DDEV.  See below.

1. Install [Docker](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/docker-installation/) for your system.
2. Install [DDEV](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/) on your host machine.
