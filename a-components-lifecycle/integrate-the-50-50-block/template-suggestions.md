# Template Suggestions

### Exercise: Debugging the Teaser

* In your Drupal site, visit the page you created before with the 50/50 teaser.
* Right-click anywhere on the teaser and select **Inspect or inspect element**, depending on your browser. This will display the HTML that makes up the page you are currently viewing. In addition, it will display other information generated by Twig debugging. See an example of Twig debug output below (click on it to zoom in):

If you look at the image above, you will see a few things that are extremely helpful for creating the right template suggestions:

* The last line of green text <mark style="color:green;">**`BEGIN OUTPUT...`**</mark> shows where the template being used by Drupal to render the Teaser is located and what its name is <mark style="color:green;">**`modules/contrib/block_content_template/templates/block-content.html.twig`**</mark>.
* Just above that line, under <mark style="color:green;">**`FILE NAME SUGGESTIONS`**</mark><mark style="color:green;">`:`</mark>, there is a list of files all of which begin with **block-content**. Since we are using the Block Content Template module, for the teaser, Drupal is telling us we can create a Twig template with any of the names listed above and we can customize it to our needs. This list is what we mean when we say _Template suggestions_.
* The file with an <mark style="color:green;">**`x`**</mark> next to it is the template Drupal is currently using to render the Teaser.

\*\*IMPORTANT: \*\*The first rule of Drupal is "**Don't hack core**". This means you should never modify a template provided by Drupal core, or a contrib module. Instead, you create a copy of that template in your theme. This is a best practice and we are going to follow it throughout this training.
{% endhint %}

### Exercise: Creating new template suggestions

We will need to store our custom templates somewhere. To make things convenient we place our component presenter templates in the component folder itself. So in our example we will create a subdirectory inside of the "teaser" component folder.

### Steps:

1. Create a folder named "`templates`" in your teaser component folder.
2. Create a blank file named `block-content--teaser.html.twig`.\
   Now every time the 50/50 component is rendered, Drupal will use this new template and not the one provided by our contributed module.
3. Next clear Drupal's cache (**Configuration > Development > Performance**)
4. Reload the page and inspect the code one more time (Right-click on Teaser and select **Inspect**).

Notice there is an <mark style="color:green;">**`x`**</mark> next to `block-content--teaser.html.twig`, which means Drupal is now using our custom twig template suggestion. In addition, notice the path of the template is now our own theme's component's sub-directory.
