# View modes

We are going to talk about an important topic which we will use many times in this training from here on out. View modes!

View modes allow site builders to have different versions (or view modes) of the same content (or entity). If we look at the Amazon example, we have outlined each of the ways in which any product can be displayed.&#x20;

### The Amazon example

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png>)

1. This is the **full view** of any product. Here you will see all the details about the product including name, brand, price, dimensions, etc.
2. This **teaser** option shows us a more compact option for the products which are the rating and a link to a page where they can be found, in addition to the image.
3. This view display is even more compact than the previous one with only an image, name and rating
4. The same is true for this **Card** view display option.
5. Finally, this option is as bare bones as possible with only the image of the product

There are actually many other ways in which a product is displayed in Amazon but we don't have enough room for all of them. The point is that based on where a product should be displayed, amazon changes the information for each display.

Drupal lets us do the same thing for our content (or blocks, media, etc). Whether they are products or article pages. View mode displays are super powerful and we will make use of them throughout this course.&#x20;

We will start by creating a new view mode display for the 50/50 teaser.
