# Front-end tooling

In our rapidly evolving industry, it is crucial to possess tools that enable us to swiftly construct both front-end and back-end environments, ensuring consistency. Just as we employ DevOps processes to rapidly generate fully composed Drupal websites using tools like composer and Drush, we require a system that automates the creation of Drupal themes. This system aims to equip us with all the necessary tools for developing a modern, adherent to best practices, and compliant front-end environment. The following are some of the tools we will utilize during this training:

* [​Mediacurrent's Theme Generator](https://github.com/mediacurrent/theme\_generator\_10): For building modern, component-ready Drupal 10 themes.
* [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/): Design system for a component library and living style-guide.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): A powerful, extensible, and feature-packed frontend toolkit.
* ​[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/): A Javascript runtime system used by most modern apps today.
* ​[NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm): Node Version Manager.
* ​[NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/): Node Package Manager to manage node dependencies.
* ​[Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/): Task runner to automate repetitive tasks such as code compile and more.
